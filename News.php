      <p class="article-paragraph">Simply put, Horizon Forbidden West, for all of the good things it did, was forced to come out just a week before the behemoth of an anticipated title that was Elden Ring. Between Forbidden West’s launch on February 18, 2023, and Elden Ring’s launch on February 25, that was just a measly week before....</p>

      <p class="article-paragraph">Overwatch 2's new Seasonal format has been an interesting concept to say the least. Map rotations have been divisive, though it is hard to argue against the steady release of new maps and heroes being healthy for the game.</p>

    <img class="article-image" src="Images/NewsImages/EldenRing.jpg">
      <p class="article-paragraph">If a song during an Elden Ring boss fight has ever hyped you up, specifically because you think its choral melodies feature lyrics speaking of your heroic deeds (what, just me?), then you should turn away from this story right now. 
        That’s because apparently, the lyrics in most Elden Ring songs are completely gibberish and void of meaning.</p>
