      <img class="article-image" src="Images/NewsImages/Skyrim.webp">
      <p class="article-paragraph">
       QuakeCon 2021 is going on now and the annual showcase kicked off with a pleasant Quake remaster announcement and a plethora of intriguing panels to listen in on. It also came with the confirmation that Skyrim is re-releasing again for the billionth time, just in case anyone forgot it existed. 
       Because this is called the Anniversary Edition, the latest re-release will be dropping on November 11 later this year, ten years post-launch. </p>

      <img class="article-image" src="Images/NewsImages/EldenRing.webp">
      <p class="article-paragraph">If a song during an Elden Ring boss fight has ever hyped you up, specifically because you think its choral melodies feature lyrics speaking of your heroic deeds (what, just me?), then you should turn away from this story right now. 

        That’s because apparently, the lyrics in most Elden Ring songs are completely gibberish and void of meaning. This news comes from Eurogamer, which discovered Reddit user Magister Organi, a student studying Latin, and their diligent attempted translation of the songs of Elden Ring. </p>

      <p class="article-paragraph">A PC version of Gran Turismo 7 is reportedly not in active development, according to Polyphony Digital president Kazunori Yamauchi.

        Late last month, Yamauchi said that Polyphony Digital was "considering" developing a PC port of the most recent instalment to the Gran Turismo franchise. However, when asked 
        by Dengeki Online if a PC version was actually in active development, Yamauchi responded with, "That's not true.</p>

      <h2 class="article-title"> Most Overlooked Game of 2022 - Horizon Forbidden West</h2>
      <img class="article-image" src="Images/NewsImages/horizon1.webp" alt="Featured Article Image">
      <p class="article-paragraph">Simply put, Horizon Forbidden West, for all of the good things it did, was forced to come out just a week before the behemoth of an anticipated title that was Elden Ring. Between Forbidden West’s launch on February 18, 2023, and Elden Ring’s launch on February 25, that was just a measly week before we moved from one amazing open world adventure to another one. It’s a true shame too because that is hardly enough time to really enjoy everything Horizon Forbidden West had to offer. Don’t get us wrong. 
        We loved Forbidden West and we loved Elden Ring, but you have to admit it’s a little unfair if you were a fan of both.</p>

      <img class="article-image" src="Images/NewsImages/NewCyberPubk.webp" alt="Featured Article Image">
      <p class="article-paragraph">CD Projekt Red president and joint-CEO Adam Kiciński said during an investors conference that Cyberpunk 2077 will receive this updated edition in a similar vein (but maybe not with the same branding) as the Game of the Year edition of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

        "I don’t want to announce editions. I’ve said it because it is the natural way of things," he is confirmed as saying. "We did the same with The Witcher 3, which - after two expansions - was finally published as a Game of the Year Edition, and has been distributed in this form ever since. So - we should expect the same here; it’s a fairly natural direction for us to take."</p>

      <img class="article-image" src="Images/NewsImages/RezidentEvil.webp" alt="Featured Article Image">
      <p class="article-paragraph">Resident Evil 4 is arguably the best entry in Capcom’s iconic horror franchise. The game’s staying power is particularly noteworthy as several re-releases and a (leaked) remake continue to bring Leon’s action-packed journey through the plagued Spanish countryside to newcomers and old school players. Moreover, a Resident Evil 4 fan-made Remaster that’s been eight years in the making is slated to finally launch next month, as reported by Eurogamer. And based on the extensive trailer (seen below), it was well worth the wait.</p>

      <img class="article-image" src="Images/NewsImages/FF.webp" alt="Featured Article Image">
      <p class="article-paragraph">Final Fantasy 16 is only half a year away—for PlayStation 5 owners. Sadly, over here on PC, we're in for a longer wait before we get to slam Eikons together in the latest mainline Final Fantasy's megabeast battles.
        This is the first wholly new mainline Final Fantasy sequel since Final Fantasy 15 (opens in new tab) and, in true series form, it appears to star brand new characters in a whole new world. And by all appearances, its going to play like something between FFVII Remake and a Kaiju battle film.
        
        Here's everything we know, and have speculated, about Final Fantasy 16</p>

      <img class="article-image" src="Images/NewsImages/Overwatch2.webp" alt="Featured Article Image">
      <p class="article-paragraph">Overwatch 2's new Seasonal format has been an interesting concept to say the least. Map rotations have been divisive, though it is hard to argue against the steady release of new maps and heroes being healthy for the game. Balancing has been hit or miss, though the battle pass provides good value even if fans wish it came with virtual currency. However, nothing exemplifies the hit or miss nature of Overwatch 2 better than its seasonal themes.</p>
